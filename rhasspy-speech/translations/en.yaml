configuration:
  # Audio
  volume_multiplier:
    name: Volume multiplier
    description: >-
      Constant to multiply audio samples by (> 1 is louder, < 1 is quieter).
  # VAD
  vad:
    name: Remove silence
    description: >-
      Remove audio before speech is detected.
  vad_threshold:
    name: Silence threshold
    description: >-
      Threshold for voice activity detection (0-1).
  before_speech_seconds:
    name: Before speech seconds
    description: >-
      Seconds of audio to keep before speech is detected.
  # Speex
  speex:
    name: Clean audio
    description: >-
      Clean audio with Speex.
  speex_noise_suppression:
    name: Noise suppression level
    description: >-
      Amount of noise suppression (negative, lower is more suppression)
  speex_auto_gain:
    name: Auto gain level
    description: >-
      Amount of auto gain (higher is more gain)
  # Edit distance
  norm_distance_threshold:
    name: Word edit distance threshold
    description: >-
      Normalized edit distance threshold (0-1).
      Allows a percentage of characters in the transcript to be changed.
  # Transcribers
  streaming:
    name: Streaming decoding
    description: >-
      Decode in streaming mode (faster, but less accurate).
  max_active:
    name: Maximum ARPA candidates
    description: >-
      Maximum number of language model candidates during decoding.
  lattice_beam:
    name: ARPA lattice beam width
    description: >-
      Width of lattice beam during language model decoding.
  acoustic_scale:
    name: ARPA acoustic weight scale
    description: >-
      Acoustic weight scale during ARPA decoding (smaller to adhere more to the language model).
  beam:
    name: ARPA beam width
    description: >-
      Width of beam during pruning Viterbi beam search in ARPA decoding.
  nbest:
    name: Number of best candidates
    description: >-
      Number of best candidates to consider in matching.
      More candidates increases tolerance to noise, but is slower.
      Set to 1 if using grammar decode mode.
  decode_mode:
    name: Decode mode
    description: >-
      Decoding mode.
      grammar is fast, but inflexible.
      arpa is flexible, but slower.
      arpa_rescore is flexible and more accurate, but slowest.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  arpa_rescore_order:
    name: Rescore ARPA order
    description: >-
      N-gram order of rescored language model. Higher is more accurate, but slower.
      Requires decode mode set to arpa_rescore.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  # Misc
  debug_logging:
    name: Debug logging
    description: >-
      Enable debug logging.
